# Cozy Crochet
This repository contains a site centred around crochet. Here it will provide crochet patterns and inspiration for crochet projects. 

## MVP
The MVP is to create a site for crochet patterns and crochet project inspiration.
Here i want to render a list of crochet patterns and render a list of blog posts. I also i want to make the website accessible and responsive.

## Deployment 
The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://cozy-crochet.netlify.app/) and the source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/3ffie/cozy-crochet-site).
